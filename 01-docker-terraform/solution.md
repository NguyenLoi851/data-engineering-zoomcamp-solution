## Question 1. Understanding Docker images

Run docker with the `python:3.13` image. Use an entrypoint `bash` to interact with the container.

What's the version of `pip` in the image?

- 25.3
- 24.3.1
- 24.2.1
- 23.3.1

### Solution

```bash
docker run -it --entrypoint=bash python:3.13
pip --version
```

## Question 2. Understanding Docker networking and docker-compose

Given the following `docker-compose.yaml`, what is the `hostname` and `port` that pgadmin should use to connect to the postgres database?

```yaml
services:
  db:
    container_name: postgres
    image: postgres:17-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: 'postgres'
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: 'postgres'
      POSTGRES_DB: 'ny_taxi'
    ports:
      - '5433:5432'
    volumes:
      - vol-pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  pgadmin:
    container_name: pgadmin
    image: dpage/pgadmin4:latest
    environment:
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL: "pgadmin@pgadmin.com"
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD: "pgadmin"
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - vol-pgadmin_data:/var/lib/pgadmin

volumes:
  vol-pgdata:
    name: vol-pgdata
  vol-pgadmin_data:
    name: vol-pgadmin_data
```

- postgres:5433
- localhost:5432
- db:5433
- postgres:5432
- db:5432

If multiple answers are correct, select any 
Unable to connect to server:

### Solution

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
Then access http://localhost:8080 to register server 


Key rules
- Containers talk to each other using the container’s internal port, not the mapped host port.
- The hostname is the service name (or container name).

Analyze
- pgAdmin container will connect to postgre container through db:5432 || postgres:5432
- pgAdmin application on Mac will connect to postgre container through localhost:5433


## Prepare the Data

Download the green taxi trips data for November 2025:

```bash
wget https://d37ci6vzurychx.cloudfront.net/trip-data/green_tripdata_2025-11.parquet
```

You will also need the dataset with zones:

```bash
wget https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/misc/taxi_zone_lookup.csv
```

### Solution
After downloading data and creating docker compose file, we
- create file to read data from csv and parquet file and write to database
- create Dockerfile to run this above file
```bash
docker build -t taxi_ingest:v001 .

docker network ls

docker run -it \
  --network=docker_default \
  -v $(pwd):/app/data \
  taxi_ingest:v001 \
    --host=postgres \
    --port=5432 \
    --table_name=green_taxi_trips \
    --file_path=/app/data/green_tripdata_2025-11.parquet

docker run -it \
  --network=docker_default \
  -v $(pwd):/app/data \
  taxi_ingest:v001 \
    --host=postgres \
    --port=5432 \
    --table_name=zones \
    --file_path=/app/data/taxi_zone_lookup.csv
```

Notes:
- We need mount volume so container can read data in file csv or parquet
- We can run it with python directly (without Dockerfile), but we need to update the parameter of host and port (like default parameter)

## Question 3. Counting short trips

For the trips in November 2025 (lpep_pickup_datetime between '2025-11-01' and '2025-12-01', exclusive of the upper bound), how many trips had a `trip_distance` of less than or equal to 1 mile?

- 7,853
- 8,007
- 8,254
- 8,421

```bash
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM public.green_taxi_trips
where lpep_pickup_datetime >= '2025-11-01 00:00:00'
and lpep_pickup_datetime < '2025-12-01 00:00:00'
and trip_distance <= 1
```

## Question 4. Longest trip for each day

Which was the pick up day with the longest trip distance? Only consider trips with `trip_distance` less than 100 miles (to exclude data errors).

Use the pick up time for your calculations.

- 2025-11-14
- 2025-11-20
- 2025-11-23
- 2025-11-25

```bash
SELECT lpep_pickup_datetime
FROM public.green_taxi_trips
where trip_distance < 100
order by trip_distance desc
limit 1
```

## Question 5. Biggest pickup zone

Which was the pickup zone with the largest `total_amount` (sum of all trips) on November 18th, 2025?

- East Harlem North
- East Harlem South
- Morningside Heights
- Forest Hills

```bash
SELECT "Zone", SUM(g.total_amount) AS total_amount
FROM public.green_taxi_trips g JOIN public.zones z
ON g."PULocationID" = z."LocationID"
AND DATE(g.lpep_pickup_datetime) = '2025-11-18'
GROUP BY "Zone"
ORDER BY total_amount DESC
LIMIT 1
```

## Question 6. Largest tip

For the passengers picked up in the zone named "East Harlem North" in November 2025, which was the drop off zone that had the largest tip?

Note: it's `tip` , not `trip`. We need the name of the zone, not the ID.

- JFK Airport
- Yorkville West
- East Harlem North
- LaGuardia Airport

```bash
select zdo."Zone", g.tip_amount
from public.green_taxi_trips g 
JOIN public.zones zpu
	on g."PULocationID" = zpu."LocationID"
	and zpu."Zone" = 'East Harlem North'
	and g.lpep_pickup_datetime >= '2025-11-1 00:00:00'
	and g.lpep_pickup_datetime < '2025-12-1 00:00:00'
JOIN public.zones zdo
	on g."DOLocationID" = zdo."LocationID"
order by g.tip_amount desc
limit 1
```

## Terraform

In this section homework we'll prepare the environment by creating resources in GCP with Terraform.

In your VM on GCP/Laptop/GitHub Codespace install Terraform.
Copy the files from the course repo
[here](../../../01-docker-terraform/terraform/terraform) to your VM/Laptop/GitHub Codespace.

Modify the files as necessary to create a GCP Bucket and Big Query Dataset.


## Question 7. Terraform Workflow

Which of the following sequences, respectively, describes the workflow for:
1. Downloading the provider plugins and setting up backend,
2. Generating proposed changes and auto-executing the plan
3. Remove all resources managed by terraform`

Answers:
- terraform import, terraform apply -y, terraform destroy
- teraform init, terraform plan -auto-apply, terraform rm
- terraform init, terraform run -auto-approve, terraform destroy
- terraform init, terraform apply -auto-approve, terraform destroy
- terraform import, terraform apply -y, terraform rm

### Solution
- Create file main.tf and variables.tf
- Create new project on GCP and generate keys for service account
- Update data for terraform files

```bash
terraform fmt
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
terraform destroy
```
